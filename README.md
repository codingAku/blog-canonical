### Notes

- The displayed title of the post cards are _Group Names_ fetched from the post data. This part could easily be changed into categories or topics, this was a choice made by the developer.

- The card content are innerly rendered text of blog posts. This part could be categories, however due to unclearity, the developer decided to display the text.

- Please share your valuable insights about the project with me! Thank you so much for viewing and I hope to show my skills more with the experienced team of Canonical! ðŸ’–
